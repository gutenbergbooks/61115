<h2><i>Drippings From the Fawcett</i></h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">A few months ago a newspaper friend of
mine in New Orleans wrote about having
taken a drink of the Louisiana brand and
then backing against a bale of cotton as he
said: “Come on, boy, let’s go.” I didn’t appreciate
his humor very much at that time because
I had been on the wagon for several months.
I had not touched the “fiery flare” that “stealeth
away the mind” principally because the
morning after the night before found me in such
condition that it seemed to take months of the
“tapering off” process to get back in shape.</p>

<p>However, the devil got the upper hand again
and, as usual, there was the devil to pay. Somebody
presented me with a nice, new-appearing
black bottle bearing a shiny, greenish colored
label. The alleged bonded stamp had a peculiar
shade and indicated a bourbon of twelve summers.
The contents, however, bore the taste of
a reverse action to an old maid’s age. But the
cayenne pepper, ether and tobasco sauce got in
its damnable work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>Two hours later I passed by the Ashley Airport,
located in Robbinsdale near the Whiz
Bang farm. Instead of backing against a bale
of cotton, I backed against a 90 horsepower
aeroplane, handed the pilot my last $50 and
said: “Come on, Gus, let’s go.” And, believe
me, Gus and I went some before we got off this
last “bender.”</p>

<p>The pilot, Homer Cole, veteran of four
years’ service in France, fulfilled his duties in
a business-like way, while Gus and myself were
filling ourselves in an unbusiness-like way. Our
first stop was Brainerd, Minn., a hustling city
about 150 miles north of Robbinsdale. We had
so much real or fancied fun on our first flight
that we enveigled Cole to make another leap of
22 miles to Breezy Point lodge in the old Indian
territory. Of course in the meantime we had
ridded ourselves of our visible supply of tobasco
sauce and both knew that our stay in
my Pequot log cabin resort must be brief.
Therefore, the very bright and brilliant idea
soaked in the hired man’s dome, that an
airship would be a necessary permanent adjunct
for traveling back and forth between
Robbinsdale and Pequot.</p>

<p>Gus conducted negotiations with Cole and
learned that his plane could be purchased on
the installment plan. The deal was soon closed
and at this writing the plane is partly mine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
We managed to last it out for one day in the
North pine woods and early next morning
hopped off for Minneapolis, with its fond memories
of many mills and motley moonshine.</p>

<p>Later in the day, my brother, Harvey, who now
conducts the business end of the little old Whiz
Bang, located Gus and I in a gin mill. He
handed me a nice letter of invitation to attend
a convention of the Independent Magazine Distributors
at the Schlitz Hotel at Atlantic City.
While the convention notice sounded mighty
good, the name of the hotel suggested a hankering
for the good old days.</p>

<p>Gus was heart-broken, to think that I would
leave him behind and as he had performed
valiant service as caretaker of Pedro, our pedigreed
bull, and the cows and chickens during
many years as Whiz Bang farm hand, I granted
his plea to accompany me.</p>

<p>We landed safe, sound and, as usual, sick
in the McAlpin in New York City. It was
Gus’ longest train ride and incidentally his first
visit to the big village. At the outset he refused
to remove his overalls, rubber collar and
red necktie, which was quite embarrassing to
me. We had a swell room on the tenth flight,
with carpets on the floor and brass buttoned
fellows to wait on us. We were informed we
could get no liquor in New York unless we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
were Enright. Gus promptly formed the advance
guard on the Great White Way, or whatever
you call it, and soon we were both in right.
After an eye opener or two, my hired man
asked the genial barkeep for the location of
the wash-room. He was shown an ante-room
which bore the sign: “Gentlemen.” He walked
right in anyway. Nothing in New York seemed
to deter this faithful, simple Minnesota farm-hand.</p>

<p>That night we received a telegram from
Robbinsdale cautioning us to make reservations
in the Schlitz Hotel at Atlantic City, as that
institution might be full on account of the convention.
Gus read the message to me, threw it
in the waste basket as he nonchalantly remarked:
“If the Schlitz Hotel is full it has
nothing on me.”</p>

<p>The next day it was Atlantic City or bust.
We arrived in rather good shape and were
assigned a pleasant room overlooking the Atlantic
and the famous boardwalk. I induced
Gus to take a bath, although he insisted he
didn’t need one and that anyway it wasn’t the
right time of the month. A little bribe, however,
brought him around to his senses and
after his plunge, I handed him a ten dollar bill
to go about and enjoy himself. Before leaving
the room he was strictly cautioned to beware
of pickpockets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>Gus returned several hours later and, I am
sorry to relate, was a little the worse for wear.
He had a puzzled, sorrowful look on his face.
After a few moments of hesitation he confessed—he
had been “touched.” The mystery of the
missing mazuma was cleared later that night
when I coaxed him to take off his socks before
crawling into bed. There in the dark recess
of his left light blue stocking was hidden a
five and a two dollar bill. “Gosh, but I forgot
all about hiding it,” he exclaimed with a
sigh of relief.</p>

<p>Next day we “dolled up” as pretty as possible
so as to be somewhat presentable at the
convention banquet. We had just started to
leave the room when Gus became so grief
stricken that I was forced to cancel the engagement
and remain by his bedside. The shock
came in the form of a telegram from Maggie,
the hired girl, and read as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Pedro took violently ill last night from heart disease—Horse
Doctor Hawkins unable to diagnose his sickness
and Pedro was rushed on truck to Minneapolis—Bull specialists
in the Midway Packing plant say his trouble is
homesickness due to Gus’ absence—All hope given up—What
shall we do?”</p>

</div>

<p>An hour later, while Gus was still shedding
tears and demanding that we return home at
once, we received a second message, this one
from my brother, which read:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Pedro died at 6:00 o’clock—Does Gus want his body
brought to Robbinsdale for burial?—A son was born to the
Hereford cow one hour after Pedro passed—Have named
him Pedro Junior after his father, which assures continuation
of the Pedro Bullage.”</p>

</div>

<p>Pedro’s death and my intermittent headaches
rather dampened our spirits and so we
started back for Robbinsdale. Waiting in Chicago
for our connections to Minnesota, and
wishing to cheer up Gus and to ease the pain
of Pedro’s death I said to him, “Gus, you have
done pretty good on the trip so I will get you
something nice. What do you want?” We were
just passing a bird store and Gus said,
“Get me a pet monkey.” So I bought him a
ring tail monk, which he now has at Breezy
Point and with which he spends most of his
time after his day’s work.</p>

<p>As this is written I have somewhat overcome
the effects of tapering off, but the memory
of this last jamboree has made an everlasting
record on Gus’ snoose dampened mind.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Deacon Miller’s son, Pete, has a new
racket. It appears that he bought a golden
trombone from some Chicago mail
order house, and every night he entertains the
boys and girls of the neighborhood with his
melodies. Everybody likes to see the way Pete
is coming to the front and when it comes to
playing fast music, etc., Pete can slide that
golden trombone in and out to beat the band.</p>

<h3>IN MEMORIAM</h3>

<p class="dropcap">Gus and Maggie wish to express their
heartfelt thanks for the kind sympathy
and the beautiful flowers attending
the recent bereavement of their beloved Pedro,
famed pedigreed bull, to whom
we were very much attached and who died
from shortness of breath, superinduced by
a severe case of homesickness, due to the
absence of his favored master, Gus, during
Mr. Gus’ recent trip to Broadway. It is
our joy and comfort to let our many friends
know that Pedro’s place in our hearts will
be partly filled by his young son, Pedro, Jr.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">We went to church last Sunday for a
change and the minister preached a
sermon about Lot’s wife looking back
and turning into a pillar of salt. We were telling
Gus, our hired man, about the sermon, and
Gus says he was walking around Robbinsdale
Monday evening and saw the minister strolling
with Deacon Smith’s wife, and when they
looked back and saw Gus, both of them turned
into a dark side street.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Whiz Bang readers will remember some
time ago we got a letter from a fellow
on the Pacific Coast who enquired if his
long lost brother from Sweden was our hired
man, Gus. It developed later that this was
true and Gus and his brother, Ole, staged a reunion
the other day, but as Gus’ brother is not
any too dainty and as he has weak pedals, I was
unable to find a position for him on the Whiz
Bang farm. However, Gus solved the difficulty
by getting his brother a job as street cleaner
in Robbinsdale, and after the first day, Ole quit
and said that Robbinsdale was too fast for
him. At least that is the impression we got
from him, for he said Robbinsdale was no one
horse town.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Rus Morrissey says we were in error in
declaring that a whiffenpoof was a fish
that swims backwards to keep water out
of its eyes, and that a whiffenpoof really is a
dog whose left legs are shorter than its right
legs so that the said whiffenpoof dog can walk
around a hill without losing its balance. Some
dorg, we’d say!</p>

<h2><i>Our Movie Gossip</i></h2>

</div>

<p class="by">BY RICHMOND</p>

<p class="dropcap">The Whiz Bang is hearing all sorts of
rumors and gossip wheezes from the
movie camps surrounding the City of Angels,
regarding the antics of Clara Smith Hamon,
who recently was freed in the Ardmore,
Oklahoma, shooting case and who is now attempting
to break into the picture game with
her “life-story” to teach young girls to beware
of oil kings and others.</p>

<p>According to the consensus of whisperings,
Clara is having a difficult time getting studio
artists to work for her in the production of the
alleged “reform” photoplay. It is reported she
is offering fabulous salaries from the fund of
$10,000 which Jake Hamon is supposed to have
left her, in an endeavor to put over the picture.
One camera man said he was offered $500
a week, and Mason Litson, former Goldwyn
director, was reported to have turned down an
offer of $750 a week.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>Los Angeles says that besides the Motion
Picture Directors’ association voting to expel
any member who aids Clara, the Screen
Writers’ Guild has taken action against the
Hamon photoplay. If all this dope is true,
Clara will have a job on her hands illustrating
her adventures to young girls via the screen
play. Even after the play is produced, if it
ever is, Clara will find it a task to find theatres
to exhibit it in.</p>

<p>Pauline Frederick is now on her way west
again from a recent trip to New York. They
say she whispered to a close friend in the depot
in New York as she was leaving, that she and
Willard Mack will again wed very soon.</p>

<p>This recalls to mind the gossip that revolved
about their previous engagement when Pauline
was playing at the Famous studio in New York
City several years ago. While she and Mack
were engaged—he was waiting to get a divorce
from Marjorie Rambeau at the time—it is said
he wavered for a time and showed a decided
inclination toward returning to the fair and
beautiful Marjorie. Pauline became so alarmed
over losing her playwright prize that it is
said she approached Marjorie.</p>

<p>So Pauline got him, then they separated.
Last winter the beautiful Barbara Castleton,
former Goldwyn star, went east, joined one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Willard Mack’s vaudeville acts, and it was reported
was engaged to wed Mack. They, too,
were prevented from carrying out an immediate
marriage because of one of those bothersome
final decrees.</p>

<p>Barbara, by the way, while at the Goldwyn
studio was one day discovered in a refined but
tempestuous love scene with a tall, raven-haired
English actor. Maybe it was part of a
picture, but took place way out on a dark, deserted
stage beneath a huge black cloth used to
keep the dust off from the furniture! An electrician
stumbled upon the romantic scene and
when the story was whispered about the studio
it is said the poor electrician was cross questioned
and put through the third degree by
Hollywood’s best gossips.</p>

<p>It seems that the English actor has a wife
somewhere in the Empire—Australia or Ireland—so
Barbara was daily reported to be infatuated
with some other admirer. It seems
her romantic passion for Mack “took,” for she
allowed the press to announce the fact that
they intended to wed when he won his decree
from the emotional Pauline, “Polly” as she is
known.</p>

<p>Another interesting angle of the case is to
the effect that Pauline never rode a horse until
last winter. One of the Goldwyn pictures required
this feat, so one perfectly handsome cowboy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
was engaged to teach “Polly” to ride. The

<p>Army teamsters are known for their science
of cursing. One of the trucks was deep in the
mud and defied all his efforts and curses. A
chaplain passing just then shocked.</p>

<p>“Friend, don’t you know who died for sinners?”
he said. The answer was quick, “Damn
your conundrums; can’t you see I’m stuck in

<h2><i>Bobbed Hair Genii</i></h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Although the rest of New York can’t
seem to see why they are so excited about
it, all the high brow married ladies of
Greenwich Village are in a lather of emotion.
Ruth Hale has set ’em free.</p>

<p>Rah for liberty, freedom and Ruth!</p>

<p>Owing to Ruth, the down-trodden girls with
bobbed hair and hubbies, no matter how many
times they are married, need not lug around
the old man’s name any longer. No more of
this “Mrs.” stuff south of Washington Square.</p>

<p>It seems that the young lady genii who inhabit
the Village and have flights of soul and
yearn and yearn, occasionally fall in love and
get married and go to live in apartments with
kitchenettes, dumb waiters, husbands and other
furniture. But to their intense indignation,
the butcher and everybody right away begins
calling them Mrs. Thingambob, entirely forgetting
the undying fame of the names they
used to sign to their poems. So the girls proceeded
to strike.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>Fannie Hurst, the lady who says her husband
comes to call on her twice a week, Inez
Gillmore, who is married to Will Irwin, and a
lot of girls similarly encumbered, organized the
Lucy Stone League, Lucy being a lady who refused
to stand for the outrage way back in
1855. Ruth Hale was one of the members. She
is a writer young lady who married Heywood
Broun, the dramatic critic, and dared anybody
to call her Mrs. Broun.</p>

<p>The United States government took the
dare. When she wanted to go to Europe, the
State Department got in bad with Greenwich
Village by writing out her passport in the
name of “Mrs. Heywood Broun.” She indignantly
refused to accept it, refusing to go to
Europe at all and leaving the place flat.</p>

<p>She has now won what the girls consider
to be a tremendous victory for “The Cause.”
Through the courts she has compelled a real
estate owner to deed a certain piece of property
to “Heywood Broun and Ruth Hale, his wife.”
The Greenwich Village ladies straightaway
celebrated the event by adopting a new constitution
for the Lucy Stone League—which is
one way of giving a cheer, not to say a yell of
triumph.</p>

<p>If it’s all right with Ruth, it’s all right with
me, but it is certainly going to make complications.
You will have to keep dragging the host<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
of the party off to one side and keep demanding
in a hoarse whisper, “Say, before this goes
any further, is this Jane somebody’s wife?”</p>

<p>There’s also another terrible affair in the
Village. Every bobbed hair is on end with excitement
over what happened to “Grace” of the
famous “Grace’s Garret.” This is one of the
places in the Village where they get together
and tell each other how the jealous magazine
editors have turned down their work through
spite.</p>

<p>Grace Godwin—of course, she has a husband
named Sperry, but that doesn’t count—runs the
place, she says, more as a harbor for lonely
souls than as a depot for eats. Well, the other
day, five or six lonely souls happened in for a
dish of tea; but all the said lonely souls were
inhabiting black bodies. Grace called the lightest
colored one aside and told him how it was.
Of course, the Village is awfully democratic
and all that but—well, he ought to be able to
see for himself—with so many of the other
lonely souls being hot-headed Southerners and
all. How was she to know that the colored
brother was a famous sociologist with a Yale
degree and that the rest of the party were all
university high brows. They brought law
suits against her and got a verdict for $600,
which is more money than the Village ever
heard of at one time before. Grace of “Grace’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Garret” has given the Village solemn warning
that if any more dark tinged lonely souls come
along she is going to close “The Garret” and
move out of the Village.</p>

<p>But if it comes to that, everybody else is
moving out of the Village anyhow. So many
purse-proud outsiders have invaded New
York’s Latin Quarter that the rents are murder
in the first degree. The real Villagers are
moving out to Brooklyn—than which there
could be no worse fate for a Villager.</p>

<p>Ziegfield Follies girls tell me that all the
time the police were supposed to be searching
for Nicky Arnstein, the alleged bond robber,
Nicky was in his wife’s dressing room. He is
married to Fannie Brice of the Follies and used
to come to the show every night disguised as
her colored maid.</p>

<p>Now that we are on the topic, a burning
piece of information should be hurried out to
the waiting world. Ziegfield says that hereafter
he is going to have all the chorus men
in the show sing from behind the scenes. Nobody
wants to see them anyhow. Hereafter,
they just represent noise—like a drum.</p>

<p>A little movie girl of my acquaintance has
recently joined the Follies and what she sees
behind the scenes at the Famous beauty show
fills her with awe for the human appetite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>“To tell you the truth,” she says, “Those
girls don’t care much about millionaires. They
infinitely prefer to go around with chauffeurs
because they don’t have to worry about which
fork to eat with. They have to have millionaires
around on account of their appetites. No
ordinary fortune could keep those girls filled
up. In a previous existence most of them must
have been boa constrictors. They eat all the
time. One girl, famous for her beauty, starts
in with a good dinner before the show. All
during the intervals when she is not on the
stage, she has waiters bring her lunches in her
dressing room. Her bill averages forty dollars
a week for the little snacks she eats between
her dinner before the show and the supper with
a millionaire after the show. That girl ought
to marry a Service of Supply Depot.”</p>

<p>The little newcomer says that nearly all
the lovely beauties whom we have imagined as
dining on lark’s tongues and poetry have appetites
like traffic cops.</p>

<p>What they need in New York right now is
a new country for the movie stars to be born in.
They have a dreadful time trying to get Pola
Negri located. Ever since the foreign pictures
began to pour in with this Negri lady in the
leading part of most of the plays, they have
been trying to get her born in some inoffensive
place. The press agents have had her in turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
an Italian, a Swiss, an Austrian and a Roumanian.
As a matter of fact the lady’s real
name is Paulette Schwartz. I can’t possibly
imagine what her nationality can be!</p>

<p>Similarly worried, the film magnates have
finally decided that Josef Schildkraut is part
Turkish and part Roumanian.</p>

<p>Well, never mind, they are both great artists.
Two of the greatest Europe has ever
sent us.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, Pola Negri has reconciled the
rival film producers to the horrors of censorship.
Only a few weeks ago, they were appealing
to high heaven to be saved from the monster.
Now it has occurred to them that censorship
is the only protection the American film
industry has against being swept to destruction
by cheap but beautiful German pictures.</p>

<p>The competition is almost murderous. “Passion,”
the super film in which Negri first appeared
in America and which would have cost
at least half a million dollars in the United
States, was made for $22,000 in Berlin. Pola
Negri gets a salary whose bigness has made
Germany open its eyes; in our money it would
be only $45 a week. Of course, there could be
but one outcome to competition like that.
Nearly all the German pictures and particularly
all those of Pola Negri are decidedly “rough”
in spots. They are very much bedroom, etc.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
The American censors may save the situation
by cutting the gizzards out of them. A big
Italian picture recently arrived in New York
wherein the extra people were paid four cents
a day. It was a very beautiful and very fine
picture. There’s no denying it. Only the censors
can save the movies.</p>

<p>That long suffering and modest soul, Evelyn
Nesbit, has finally retired from the stage after
some years spent in a vain attempt to startle
the world with her “message” to young girls.
She has opened a novelty store in the “roaring
fifties” in New York City and will manage it
in person.</p>

<h3>“<i>YOU HOLD MY WIFE</i>”</h3>

<p class="center sans">A Comedy On “Behold My Wife”</p>

<p class="by">BY JAMES STARR</p>

<p class="dropcap">There is in “You Hold My Wife,” which
George Selford has screened from Sir Filbert
Barker’s “The Translation of a
Shimmy Dancer,” the sort of romance that
appeals to all the primitive story-loving instincts
of the widely known human race. A
bum of an Englishman seeking a fortune in
the Judson Bay country hears from home that
his fiancee has not married another man as he
had hoped she would. He is led to believe his
own family had deliberately planned to go
against his plans. To be even with them he
drinks a pint of likker, marries an Indian girl,
Lali, the daughter of old Fry-on-the-moon, and
ships her to England as his wife. The good
sports of the English family, dismayed and
shocked, take the savage in hand and, of course,
turn her out a raving beauty in two reels. So
that when the bum English chap, stricken finally
by remorse and put on his feet by a two-gallon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
can of likker, returns to England to recover
his squaw, he finds her a social sensation of the
season and the mother of a fine little son. He
tells her that it is not his son, she faints, he
cries to the servant, who is handy, “You Hold
My Wife,” the servant does. The English chap
leaves the house and joins a circus.</p>

<h3>“<i>MIDSUMMER BADNESS</i>”</h3>

<p class="center sans">A Comedy On “Midsummer Madness”</p>

<p class="dropcap">There are a few directors of pictures you
can not depend upon for the sane, sensible
and spirited productions. Billie The
Mille is one, no longer just Sesil’s brother, but
one who calls himself a director, no one knows
why, but he does. Billy’s latest is a photographic
essay, a world beater, a sensation, but
it is unbelievable. The Mille has woven a real
bum story, telling it by captions and not by
pictures, such as all good directors do some
time in their life, we all make mistakes, and
Billy has just started at the beginning of his
long list. No one knows just why this picture

the restless public, they will stand for anything
and Billy knows it. He is a wise guy. In the
story there is the new idea of the neglectful
husband and a guy that likes this guy’s wife,
the neglectful husband likes the other guy’s
wife. They should swap each other’s wife and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
let it go at that, but Billy wouldn’t have it
that way, so he made them love each other for
awhile and then he tore them apart. The master
of this picture put in a subtitle reading
“The End” and let the public go home for the
evening to start a drama of their own.</p>

<p>The Sydney Bulletin tells a fairly good story
about family foibles. Here it is:</p>

<p>The thud-thud of swiftly moving feet gave
me warning as I was about to turn the corner,
and I drew back to avoid a collision. An agitated
figure, his breath coming in sobs, whirled
past me and leaped on to a car that was leaving
the car-stop; and almost at the same moment
another shape shot around the corner and fell
upon me. He released me at once and apologized
profusely. Gazing furiously at the car,
now fading in the distance, he explained the
situation. “That man’s wife,” he said bitterly,
“ran away from him and came to be my housekeeper,
and just now, when I got home, I found
him trying to make love to her. The dirty cur.”</p>

<h2><i>Whiz Bang Editorials</i></h2>

<p class="by">“<i>The Bull is Mightier Than the Bullet.</i>”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Audrey Munson, the darling of the
studios, is telling the poor but patient
public what gorgeous parties some of the
artists have pulled off, and speaks breathlessly
of champagne baths and rose-covered stairways.
It is nothing new, Audrey; the ancients,
in the matter of luxury and license, could
knock any of the present day sports for a row
of Chinese pagodas.</p>

<p>I have recently been engaged in reading two
very interesting histories, the one of the rose,
the other of the perfumes, in reading which I
was deeply impressed with the fact that all the
civilizations of the past, previous to their downfall,
had their rose fetes, their festivals of
flowers, their perfumed halls and extravagant
balls and soirees. Before the fall of the Roman
empire; the wealthy abandoned themselves to
pleasure, luxury and licentiousness and such
expressions as “living in the midst of roses” and
“sleeping on a bed of roses” had a deep and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
tragic meaning. Seneca speaks of Smyndiride,
who could not sleep if one of the rose petals
with which his bed was spread, happened to be
curled. Cicero alludes to the then prevailing
custom among the Romans of reclining at the
table on couches covered with roses. Ah, my
jeweled buddies there were Adonises in those
days!</p>

<p>When Cleopatra, the perfumed serpent of
the Nile, went into Cilicia to meet Mark Antony,
she gave him for several successive days
a festival such as the gods themselves would
not blush to participate in. She had placed in
the banqueting hall twelve couches large
enough to hold three guests. Purple tapestry
interwoven with gold covered the walls, golden
vases admirably executed and enriched with
precious stones, stood on a magnificent gold
floor. On the fourth day the queen caused the
floor of the hall to be covered with roses to the
depth of eighteen inches. These flowers were
retained in a very fine net to allow the guests
to walk over them.</p>

<p>Nero, the fiddler of burning Rome and the
tyrant par excellence of his day, gave a fete on
the gulf of Baiae when inns were established
on the banks and ladies of noble blood played
hostesses to the occasion, the roses alone costing
more than four million of sesterces, or
$100,000.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Before her downfall Rome could spend millions
on her royal tables, support the dignity
of a single senator at $80,000 a year, employ
courts for sycophants and flatterers, impose
taxes at the pleasure of her ruler, declare any
complaint treason, marry her daughters for
money and titles, employ notaries to attest the
fatness of her banquet fowls, punish men with
death for trivial offenses and make slaves and
menials of the profoundest philosophers.</p>

<p>Considering their natural limitations, those
old boys set a pace that would keep anybody
hustling to keep up with them. The sports of
several generations back might have been veritable
hicks compared to the modern brand, but
those of several centuries back didn’t take a
back seat for none—and don’t yet!</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">In the May issue of last year, when Whiz
Bang was a baby in the magazine field, we
published a poem famed over the West
Coast, “The Girl in the Blue Velvet Band,”
which we obtained after much effort from a
former convict of San Quentin penitentiary,
wherein this masterpiece was written. Within
a week after the Whiz Bang, containing the
first publication of this poem, reached San
Francisco, that city had sold out every copy,
and a day or two later none could be purchased
from Canada to Mexico on the western slope.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
The Whiz Bang mail box was full every day
with requests for more copies of the issue containing
“The Blue Velvet Band.”</p>

<p>Consequently, we republished the poem in
our October issue, which we also called our first
Annual. The big rush of the May issue was
repeated in October, and from that time on we
have been flooded with requests for copies of
the poem. One enthusiast offered us a ten spot
if we’d have Gus, the hired man, copy the poem
from our personal files for him.</p>

<p>This year we are making the Winter Annual
a separate book, with four times as much
reading matter. “The Blue Velvet Band,” the
verse of the dope layout, the burglar and the
inner walls of San Quentin. “Lasca,” the tale
of the stampede, “The Face on the Bar-room
Floor,” and “Johnnie and Frankie,” are some
of the poems scheduled for the “Pedigreed Follies
of 1921-22” in October.</p>

<h2><i>Our Rumor Department</i></h2>

<p class="dropcap">An enthusiastic reader sends us an
epistle of inquiry. We cannot say that it
is from “Paul” to the Corinthians, because,
though the correspondent signs “Paul,”
our noble John Henry reads “Whiz Bang.”</p>

<p>Paul wants to know whether or not it is a
fact that there is anything to the rumor that
Owen Moore, former husband of Mary Pickford,
is due to marry Mildred Harris, late
wife of Charlie Chaplin? So far as Whiz Bang
knows, neither Owen nor Mildred have any wild
desires to become as one. Mildred scarcely
seems of a type that would appeal to the silent
youngster whom Mary released at Minden.
Speaking of Minden? Where is that place?
Oh, yes, up in Nevada. Wasn’t it Nevada which
was going to show the Fairbanks and Pickfords
that such sudden splitting of the wedded bonds
couldn’t be pulled off in that sanctified state?
And didn’t Whiz Bang tip you off that Nevada
was long on talk and short on official action.</p>

<p>Yes, indeedy. Doug Fairbanks puts on the
old carpet slippers and Mary smoothes his hair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
for all the world like an old married couple
and no one to say them nay, not even Nevada.</p>

<p>The “rumor” which friend Paul sent to us
reminds us forcibly again that you can hear
anything about any one in the picture world
or connected with it. Stick around the Alexandria
hotel lobby for ten minutes and the
pedigree of every male and female whose face
appears upon the screen will be peddled to you
ad libitum.</p>

<p>Three years ago the Alexandria hotel lobby
was the scene of gigantic picture operations—in
the mind. It was customary for ten million
dollar organizations to be formed every five
minutes. That was in the days of the magic
rug. It seemed no one could step on the rug
in front of the hotel counter without becoming
stricken. New studios by the thousands were
built every night between six-thirty and seven
o’clock.</p>

<p>But they don’t have the rug at the Alex
any more. Remember when Charlie Chaplin
tried to lick his wife’s manager and tripped
from the rug onto a scantling, his priceless
feet exuding themselves skyward? Since Charlie
slipped and fell, the rug has been removed.
The reason perhaps is that few hotels get a
chance to brag of Charlie Chaplin staging a
fight in their lobby and the Alexandria evidently
trusts that if a return engagement occurs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Chaplin will not be able to complain of
slippery underfooting.</p>

<p>Charlie looks better than in ages. He’s
leading the very quiet life, and working hard.</p>

<p>Reverting again to rumors. Take ’em all
and all, most of the picture “support” on the
various lots is comprised of persons who would
find it pretty rough going financially if called
upon to exercise brains. And they are petty.</p>

<p>Small town gossips of a mean nature, jealousies
and back bitings prevail. This doesn’t
always hold to the extras alone. Some of the
stars are just as bad. Harold Lloyd pays considerable
attention to Bebe Daniels. The result
is that the jealous girls have it in for
Harold and Bebe. It happens that Lloyd is a
very decent young fellow, so far as reputation
goes and many a doting mamma gets ideas in
her head when she sees the young millionaire
roll down the street in one of his splendid cars.
Up to date there has been nothing brought
against Lloyd, even by jealous ladies who
crave and don’t get his attention. He steers
clear of the jazz bunch—as clear as can be done
and remain at all popular.</p>

<p>Mildred Davis, for the past two years his
leading lady, is frequently seen in the company
of Lloyd at the fashionable gathering
places. The girl is a beautiful looking young
creature, possibly 18 or 19 years of age and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
naturally those who watch the picture hurdy-gurdy
wonder whether Lloyd is stronger for
Mildred than for Bebe. Either young lady, so
far as appearances are concerned, would go a
lot further and not meet up with a more promising
gentleman, though marriage may be furthest
from the mind of the trio. These youngsters
work hard and have to attend pretty much
to business.</p>

<p>The wild parties still prevail though they
are getting a little more exclusive. People
are chosen who don’t have a reputation for
bringing up reminders the next morning of everything
that happened. This is a good idea.
Every girl who got drunk the night before discovered
before noon next day that everyone on
the lot had heard about it.</p>

<p>In our references to Hollywood and Los Angeles
society, we don’t wish to be accused of
laying everything to the picture people. Far
from it. The high society bunch sets a faster
pace if anything. One of the wildest orgies
ever attempted in this hextic community occurred
recently in the vicinity of Elizabeth
Lake, a distance of some 80 miles from Los
Angeles.</p>

<p>It seems that the sacred inner circles of
fashion and pictures found that the ground was
being trampled upon too much by the plebeian
element and that the ensuing gossip often ended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
unpleasantly. Over canyon and mountains
many of the guests were carried by aeroplanes.
This item will be news to some who think they
are on the “inside” of the jazz doings around
Los Angeles. The ultra ultras are putting it
on stronger than ever—but far away from
home, husbands and wives.</p>

<p>Big men of the pictures and high social
standings, who never bat an eye at certain
queens of the amusement world when at work,
joined in a carnival of revelry that surpassed
most anything provided for jaded appetites
hereabouts—not excepting the nude bathing
parties for which Hollywood and Pasadena became
famous with introduction of private bathing
plunges, out of doors.</p>

<p>Outside the Sodom and Gemorrah cottage,
big powerful aeroplanes waited to carry back to
Los Angeles those who find that an air trip to
be very clarifying after a night of social carnage.
One man, it is reported, though brewed
up like a boiled owl, landed his two passengers
safely on one of the landing places near Hollywood.
There is first-hand information that
brewed up airplane drivers have operated in
the vicinity. To date the motor bike cops have
found the pave too hot for them to pinch any
one.</p>

<h3>Love As An Appetizer</h3>

<p>Any emotion that gives pleasure acts
healthily on the heart and other organs, certain

Love, hope and happiness all produce these
emotions and, contrary to the accepted notion,
the ardent lover ought to enjoy his meals thoroughly.
Despair, grief and fear are declared to
have quite the opposite effect. They make the
heart slower, and enfeeble the nervous system,
often upsetting digestion.</p>

<div class="verse">I will, says she, if you’ll agree</div>
<div class="verse">To buy some chewing gum for me.</div>
<div class="verse">So the youth was wise and bought the gum,</div>
<div class="verse">And told his dearie he wanted one.</div>
<div class="verse">All right, he heard her softly sigh,</div>
<div class="verse">The gum for me you’ll ne’er deny.</div>
<div class="verse">Now this is a thing I’ve never done,</div>
<div class="verse">Kisses, my dear, I always shun,</div>
<div class="verse">But I know I’ll like them as well as you,</div>
<div class="verse">If they’re as good as the gum I chew.</div>
<div class="verse">So she sat right down upon a chair,</div>
<div class="verse">She chewed her gum and fussed her hair,</div>
<div class="verse">And the nearer she came to the “bargained fun”</div>
<div class="verse">The faster she chewed her chewing gum.</div>
<div class="verse">Suddenly she chewed with all her might,</div>
<div class="verse">And placed her arms around him tight,</div>
<div class="verse">She swallowed her gum, and cried, “Don’t miss.</div>
<div class="verse">I love my gum, but oh, djer kiss.”</div>

<h3>His First Offense</h3>

<p>In New York City, all those who are sent
to jail for thirty days are required to take a
bath. A bath attendant upon noticing that Ike
Kabibble’s person was none too clean, suddenly
exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Hey, there, you guy! Did you ever take a
bath before?”</p>

<p>“Vell,” Abe replied, “I nefer vas arrested before.”</p>
